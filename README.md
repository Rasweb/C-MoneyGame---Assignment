## Overview
### Coin Flip Assignment

A C assignment connected to my system developer education at STI, also my first c assignment.
This is a Coin flip game where the user has a balance and can bet money on heads or tails.
Built using visual studio code so all the files are .cpp files.


### Built with

- C
- srand (randomizer library)

### In Action
This is how a run would look like:
```
You have 100 SEK. How much would you like to bet? ***10***
What do you bet on (h/t): ***h***
Tossing the coin...
It is tails.
You have lost 10 SEK
You have 90 SEK. How much would you like to bet? ***20***
What do you bet on (h/t): ***t***
Tossing the coin...
It is tails.
You have won 20 SEK
You have 110 SEK. How much would you like to bet?
```
